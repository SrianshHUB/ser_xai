DESCRIPTION: A command-line utility for making single-file emotion predictions.
CONTRIBUTION: 
1. Demonstrates how to load the trained model and perform manual feature extraction on a given audio file.
2. Serves as a quick testing tool for developers to verify model predictions outside of the web environment.
3. Provides a reference implementation for feature alignment (handling missing or extra features at inference time).
